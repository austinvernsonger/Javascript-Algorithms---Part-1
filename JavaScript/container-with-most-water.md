### Given _n_ non-negative integers $$a1, a2,...1n,$$ where each represents a point at coordinate $$(i,ai)$$. _n_ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of lineiis at \(i,ai\) and \(i, 0\). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
